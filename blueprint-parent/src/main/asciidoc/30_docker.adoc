== Docker

=== Overview

This application provides also a docker image.

=== Docker Maven

For creating the docker image the https://github.com/spotify/dockerfile-maven[dockerfile-maven-plugin] is used. This plugin expects in a working directory (contextDirectory) all the necessary files, like Dockerfile, libs/jars etc. To achieve this, we used the https://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-resources-plugin/[maven-resources-plugin] and https://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-dependency-plugin/[maven-dependency-plugin] to copy the Dockerfile and builded jar file(s) into the context directory.

See the blueprint-web/pom.xml for details.
To build the docker image run use the profile *dockerbuild*:

`mvn -Pdockerbuild package`

To start the docker container:

`docker run -it --rm -p 8099:8099 haf-tech/blueprint:0.0.1-SNAPSHOT`
