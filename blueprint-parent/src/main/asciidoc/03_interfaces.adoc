=== Swagger AsciiDoctor Integration

Swagger (or now https://www.openapis.org/) provides the toolset for defining a REST interface. 
The Swagger JSON definition will be used to generate AsciiDoc files which holds the information for every interface; totally generated.
To achieve this is the following tool chain necessary

* springfox
** Configure and enable Swagger support
** Generate swagger.json in a test unit using the /v2/api-docs?group=Note endpoint
** Generate REST snippets (Request and Response examples) __tbd__
* swagger2markup
*** Configure to generate based on swagger.json a documentation
*** include the generated adoc

Know bugs

* AsciiDoctor-PDF: The generation a PDF from swagger documentation fails. The reason is a missing initialization in the internal lib
