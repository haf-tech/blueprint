== Docker

=== Overview

This application provides also a docker image.

=== Docker Maven

For creating the docker image the dockerfile-maven-plugin is used. This plugin expects in a working directory (contextDirectory) all the necessary files, like Dockerfile, libs/jars etc. To achieve this, we used the maven-resources-plugin and maven-dependency-plugin to copy the Dockerfile and builded jar file into the context directory.

See the blueprint-web/pom.xml for details.

To start the docker container

`docker run -it --rm -p 8099:8099 haf-tech/blueprint:0.0.1-SNAPSHOT`
